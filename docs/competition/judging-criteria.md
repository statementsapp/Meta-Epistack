## How we’ll judge

We score submissions on the dimensions below. Strong submissions don’t need to
land well on every dimension — a deep contribution on a few can still win the
top tier — but they should plausibly engage most of them.

### 1. Epistemic uplift

Does this actually help a thoughtful person reason better about the case?

- Meaningfully better than off-the-shelf deep research / top-of-range Claude
  Code investigation on the same sub-questions
- Faithful to evidence — doesn’t sand off uncertainty or smuggle in unsupported
  confidence
- Makes load-bearing evidence visible: which pieces are actually driving the
  conclusion? Which claims and evidence are getting unearned, or not enough,
  weighting in an analysis?
- Surfaces what matters: cruxes, missing perspectives, rhetorical-vs-evidential
  moves

### 2. Generalizability

Will the workflow travel?

- Works across cases of different type (curated debate / confident answer with
  complex evidence / mundane-but-contested)
- Plausibly applicable to cases beyond the three we provide
- Not narrowly overfit to the provided case studies

### 3. Compounding & shareability

Do the artefacts produced help future investigators build on this work?

- Outputs are structured / interrogable, not just narrative summaries
- Another team could pick up the artefact and extend it
- Pieces could plausibly interoperate with other submissions’ pieces

### 4. Scalability

Does the approach get better with more compute, better models, or more
contributors?

- Not bottlenecked on any single hand-designed human step
- Benefits as base-model capability rises
- Benefits from increased resources: more (adversarial) scrutiny, incremental
  sources, more effort/compute spent on checks

### 5. Methodological transparency

Is the submission well-specified enough to evaluate, replicate, and critique?

- Spec/workflow written down, with the key decisions and tradeoffs called out
- Where the creator is uncertain, that uncertainty is named — not papered over
- A judge can tell why the methodology is shaped this way, not just what it does

### 6. Adversarial robustness

How well do the artefacts and methodology hold up when participants and
consumers have differing views and priorities?

- Outputs withstand motivated reading and downstream-model interrogation
- The methodology resists being gamed by sources optimizing to mislead
- Failure modes and uncertainties are named and bounded, not hidden

### 7. Insight contribution

Does the submission shift how we think about the problem itself?

- Surfaces sub-problems, framings, or considerations we’d missed
- Critiques that force re-evaluation of promising approaches, especially with
  potent counterexamples
- Comparative analyses that surface non-obvious tradeoffs or cutting dilemmas
  across methodologies

## Prize tiers

Guidance, not a formula — judges’ discretion:

| Tier | Range | Looks like |
|---|---|---|
| Transformative | $35k–$50k | Substantial advance on the SOTA — reshapes how we think the next generation of this tooling should be built. Could be a single deep contribution or a broader push across several dimensions. |
| Strong | $15k–$35k | Notable improvement on the SOTA. Either a meaningful gain across several dimensions, or a clearly impressive gain on one. |
| Promising | $5k–$15k | A real but mild improvement on the SOTA, or a partial/exploratory contribution containing insight or working components we’d want to build on. |

Multiple prizes possible per tier; pool can expand for a wave of strong work;
strong submissions may also lead to offers of further funded work.

## Notes for judges

1. **Anchor against good baselines.** Before scoring, check what off-the-shelf
   deep research or a careful Claude Code investigation produces on the same
   sub-question. The bar is “meaningfully better than that.”
2. **Read for the spec, not the polish.** A clear workflow with a rough
   prototype usually beats a polished prototype with opaque methodology.
3. **Run it, don’t just read it.** For tool and workflow submissions, exercise
   the methodology on a sub-question you’re personally curious about —
   usefulness shows up in use, not in the writeup.
